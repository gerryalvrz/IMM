# Implementation Progress - Regenerative Finance Platform with Vesting

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1: Core Vesting)

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. TokenVesting.sol ‚úÖ
**Status**: Fully implemented and compiled

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Multiple vesting schedules per beneficiary
- ‚úÖ Cliff period support (7-60 days based on purchase timing)
- ‚úÖ Linear vesting (90-365 days based on purchase timing)
- ‚úÖ Early buyer advantage (earlier buyers get shorter vesting periods)
- ‚úÖ Claim functionality for vested tokens
- ‚úÖ View functions for claimable, vested, and locked amounts
- ‚úÖ Authorization system for bonding curve pools
- ‚úÖ Emergency revoke functionality (owner only)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic vesting parameter calculation based on supply sold

**Vesting Tiers**:
- 0-20% supply sold: 7 day cliff, 90 day vesting
- 20-50% supply sold: 14 day cliff, 180 day vesting  
- 50-80% supply sold: 30 day cliff, 270 day vesting
- 80-100% supply sold: 60 day cliff, 365 day vesting

**Key Functions**:
- `createVestingSchedule()` - Create vesting for token purchase
- `claim()` - Claim all vested tokens
- `getClaimableAmount()` - View claimable tokens
- `getLockedAmount()` - View locked tokens
- `calculateVestingParams()` - Get vesting parameters based on timing

#### 2. BondingCurvePool.sol ‚úÖ (Updated)
**Status**: Updated with vesting integration and graduation mechanics

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ Vesting contract integration

- ‚úÖ No direct token transfers (all purchases are vested)
- ‚úÖ Selling restricted to graduated pools only
- ‚úÖ Fee structure (1% buy fee, 2% sell fee)
- ‚úÖ Treasury fee distribution

- ‚úÖ Graduation progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Max supply enforcement

**Graduation Conditions** (OR logic):
- Market cap reaches 69,000 CELO (~$69k)
- 85% of max supply sold

**Fee Distribution**:
- Buy: 1% to treasury
- Sell: 2% to treasury (only after graduation)

**Key New Functions**:
- `buy()` - Purchase with automatic vesting schedule creation
- `sell()` - Only available after graduation
- `getMarketCap()` - Current market capitalization
- `getGraduationProgress()` - Progress toward graduation
- `canGraduate()` - Check if ready to graduate

#### 3. TokenFactory.sol ‚úÖ (Updated)
**Status**: Updated to deploy and configure vesting system

**New Features**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys TokenVesting contract in constructor
- ‚úÖ Treasury management
- ‚úÖ Vesting contract authorization
- ‚úÖ Max supply allocation (80% to bonding curve, 20% to creator)
- ‚úÖ Minimum initial liquidity requirement (0.01 CELO)
- ‚úÖ Input validation for token parameters
- ‚úÖ Ownership model with Ownable

**Supply Distribution**:
- 80% ‚Üí Bonding curve pool (vested on purchase)
- 20% ‚Üí Creator (immediate, could be vested separately)

**Key New Functions**:
- `setTreasury()` - Set platform treasury address
- `getVestingContract()` - Get vesting contract address
- `getTreasury()` - Get treasury address

## üêõ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Contract Issues

#### BondingCurvePool.sol
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Graduation market cap set to 69,000 CELO (adjust for testnet?)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  No pause mechanism for emergencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Max supply checking could be more robust

#### TokenFactory.sol
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Treasury initially set to deployer (needs multisig for production)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  No upgrade mechanism
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Creator tokens not automatically vested (manual process)

#### TokenVesting.sol
- ‚úÖ Well implemented, no major issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Could add batch claim for gas optimization

### Frontend Issues
- [ ] useTokenFactory needs complete rewrite for new contracts
- [ ] No vesting UI components yet
- [ ] No graduation tracking in UI
- [ ] Need real-time event listeners for vesting/graduation

## üìä Testing Checklist for Alfajores

### Smart Contract Tests

#### Token Creation
- [ ] Create token with minimum liquidity
- [ ] Verify max supply allocation (80/20 split)
- [ ] Verify vesting contract authorization
- [ ] Verify treasury configuration

#### Token Purchase (Buy)
- [ ] Buy small amount and verify vesting schedule created
- [ ] Buy large amount and verify max supply enforcement
- [ ] Verify fee collection (1%)
- [ ] Verify correct vesting parameters based on timing
- [ ] Test early buyer vesting (short periods)
- [ ] Test late buyer vesting (long periods)

#### Vesting & Claiming
- [ ] Wait for cliff period to pass
- [ ] Claim vested tokens
- [ ] Verify partial vesting (during vesting period)
- [ ] Verify full vesting (after vesting period)
- [ ] Test multiple vesting schedules per user

#### Graduation
- [ ] Reach market cap threshold

## üí° Notes & Considerations

### Testnet vs Mainnet
- Testnet should use shorter vesting periods for testing (hours instead of days)
- Consider adding a "fastForward" function for testing (testnet only)
- Market cap threshold may need adjustment for testnet liquidity

### Gas Optimization
- Vesting claim could be expensive with many schedules
- Consider batch claiming optimization
- Pool graduation check on every buy adds gas cost

### Security Considerations
- Treasury should be multisig in production
- Vesting contract owner has emergency revoke power
- No upgrade mechanism - deploy carefully
- Test extensively before mainnet

### User Experience
- Vesting should be clearly communicated before purchase
- Show countdown to cliff end
- Celebrate vesting milestones
- Make claiming obvious and easy
