# ImpactMarketMaker - Regenerative Finance Platform with Vesting

> A pump.fun-style bonding curve platform built for regenerative finance on Celo, featuring dynamic vesting to prevent pump & dumps and reward early supporters.

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

This is **NOT** just another pump.fun clone. We've built a sophisticated vesting mechanism that creates **real long-term alignment** between token creators and supporters - perfect for regenerative finance projects where impact takes time to materialize.

### Key Innovations
1. **Dynamic Vesting Tiers** - Earlier supporters get faster token access
2. **Anti-Pump & Dump** - Vesting prevents immediate selling
3. **Regenerative Focus** - Built for impact projects, not speculation
4. **Fee Structure** - Sustainable platform economics (1% buy, 2% sell)
5. **Automatic Graduation** - Successful tokens graduate to DEX trading

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Deployed on Alfajores)

#### TokenFactory (`0xb64Ef5a4aB2Fe8D8d655DA5658b8305414883a92`)
Creates tokens with bonding curve pools and automatic vesting integration.

**Features**:
- Auto-deploys TokenVesting contract
- Creates ERC20 tokens with bonding curves
- 80/20 supply split (bonding curve / creator)
- Treasury management
- Vesting authorization

#### TokenVesting (`0xa4D430F24601b1484D3103B8a26A90BD8AaF9f07`)
Manages vesting schedules for all token purchases.

**Vesting Tiers**:
| Supply Sold | Cliff | Total Vesting | Buyer Type |
|-------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| 0-20% | 7 days | 90 days | Early Buyer |
| 20-50% | 14 days | 180 days | Mid Buyer |
| 50-80% | 30 days | 270 days | Late Buyer |
| 80-100% | 60 days | 365 days | Final Buyer |

**Features**:
- Multiple schedules per user
- Cliff period before any vesting
- Linear vesting after cliff
- Partial claims allowed
- Emergency revoke (owner only)

#### BondingCurvePool
Implements quadratic bonding curve with vesting and graduation.

**Features**:
- Buy creates automatic vesting schedules
- 1% buy fee to treasury
- Selling disabled until graduation
- Graduates at:
  - 69,000 CELO market cap OR
  - 85% of max supply sold
- 2% sell fee after graduation

### Frontend

#### Hooks
- **useVesting** - Vesting contract integration
- **useTokenFactory** - Factory contract integration
- **useMetaMask** - Wallet connection

#### Components
- **VestingDashboard** - Main vesting interface at `/retro/vesting`
- **VestingScheduleCard** - Individual schedule display
- **Token creation/listing** - Token management

#### Routes
- `/retro/create-token` - Create new tokens
- `/retro/listed-tokens` - Browse all tokens
- `/retro/vesting` - View vesting schedules

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Token Creation
```
User → TokenFactory.createTokenWithLiquidity()
  ├─ Creates ERC20 token
  ├─ Deploys BondingCurvePool
  ├─ Links to TokenVesting contract
  └─ Transfers 80% supply to pool
```

### 2. Token Purchase (Buy)
```
User → BondingCurvePool.buy()
  ├─ Calculates tokens from bonding curve
  ├─ Deducts 1% fee → Treasury
  ├─ Determines vesting tier (based on timing)
  ├─ Creates vesting schedule in TokenVesting
  └─ Tokens locked (not in wallet yet!)
```

### 3. Vesting & Claiming
```
Time Passes → Tokens vest linearly
  ├─ After cliff: tokens start vesting
  ├─ User checks claimable amount
  ├─ User → TokenVesting.claim()
  └─ Vested tokens → User wallet
```

### 4. Graduation
```
Market Cap ≥ 69k CELO OR Supply ≥ 85%
  ├─ Pool.graduated = true
  ├─ Buying disabled
  ├─ Selling enabled (with 2% fee)
  └─ Future: Migrate to DEX
```

## 💡 Vision

We're building infrastructure for regenerative finance that creates real long-term alignment between projects and supporters. Unlike speculative platforms, our vesting mechanism ensures supporters are committed for the long term - perfect for climate projects, reforestation initiatives, ocean cleanup, and other impact work where results take time.

**This is Web3 for good, not just for fast.**

Made with 💚 for regenerative finance and the Celo ecosystem.
