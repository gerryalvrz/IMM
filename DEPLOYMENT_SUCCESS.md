## How It Works (Pump.Fun + Vesting Model)

### Token Creation
1. User creates token via TokenFactory
2. Factory deploys:
   - ERC20 token contract
   - BondingCurvePool with max supply
   - Links to TokenVesting contract
3. 80% of supply goes to pool, 20% to creator

### Token Purchase (Buy)
1. User sends CELO to pool's `buy()` function
2. Pool calculates tokens based on bonding curve
3. 1% fee sent to treasury
4. Pool creates vesting schedule in TokenVesting contract
5. Vesting parameters determined by timing:
   - Early purchases = shorter vesting
   - Late purchases = longer vesting
6. Tokens locked in vesting contract
7. User receives vesting schedule ID

### Vesting & Claiming
1. Cliff period must pass first (7-60 days)
2. Then tokens vest linearly over time (90-365 days)
3. User can check claimable amount anytime
4. User calls `claim()` to receive vested tokens
5. Can claim multiple times as tokens continue vesting

### Graduation
1. Pool tracks market cap and supply sold
2. When either threshold reached:
   - Market cap: 69,000 CELO
   - Supply: 85% of max
3. Pool graduates (buying disabled)
4. Selling becomes enabled (with 2% fee)
5. Future: Migrate liquidity to DEX (not yet implemented)

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [x] Contracts deployed
- [x] ABIs copied
- [x] Frontend hooks updated
- [ ] Frontend compiled (run `pnpm build`)

### Basic Tests
- [ ] **Connect wallet** to Alfajores
- [ ] **Create test token**
  - Name: "Test ReFi Token"
  - Symbol: "TREFI"
  - Supply: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion)
  - Initial liquidity: 0.1 CELO minimum

### Token Creation Test
```bash
# Via frontend at /retro/create-token
1. Connect MetaMask to Alfajores
2. Fill in token details
3. Set initial liquidity (min 0.1 CELO)
4. Click Create Token
5. Confirm transaction
6. Wait for confirmation
7. Note token address
```

### Buy Test
- [ ] **Buy small amount** (0.01 CELO)
- [ ] Verify vesting schedule created
- [ ] Check vesting parameters (should be 7 day cliff, 90 day vest for first buyer)
- [ ] Verify tokens locked in vesting contract
- [ ] Verify buy fee collected (1%)

### Vesting Test (Will take time)
- [ ] Check claimable amount immediately (should be 0 - in cliff)
- [ ] Wait for cliff to pass (7 days for early buyer, or adjust contract for testing)
- [ ] Check claimable amount (should show some tokens)
- [ ] Call `claim()` function
- [ ] Verify tokens received in wallet
- [ ] Check remaining locked amount

### Graduation Test
- [ ] Buy enough to reach 69k CELO market cap OR
- [ ] Buy 85% of max supply
- [ ] Verify graduation event emitted
- [ ] Verify buying disabled
- [ ] Verify selling enabled
- [ ] Test sell with 2% fee

## Quick Start Commands

### Check Deployment
```bash
# View contract on explorer
open https://alfajores.celoscan.io/address/0xb64Ef5a4aB2Fe8D8d655DA5658b8305414883a92
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/cesarangulo/Documents/celo/IMM
pnpm dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/retro/create-token
```

### Build Frontend
```bash
pnpm build
```

### Create Token via CLI (Advanced)
```javascript
// Using ethers.js
const factory = new ethers.Contract(
  "0xb64Ef5a4aB2Fe8D8d655DA5658b8305414883a92",
  TokenFactoryABI,
  signer
);

const tx = await factory.createTokenWithLiquidity(
  "Test Token",
  "TEST",
  ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000000000", 18), // 1 billion
  ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"), // 0.1 CELO liquidity
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1") }
);

await tx.wait();
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No UI for vesting yet** - Need to build vesting dashboard
2. **Sell disabled** - Until pool graduates (by design)
3. **No DEX migration** - Graduation currently just enables selling
4. **Treasury = Deployer** - Should be multisig in production
5. **Long vesting times** - May want shorter periods for testnet

### Testnet Considerations
- Vesting periods are production length (days/months)
- Consider creating separate testnet version with shorter vesting
- Or use Hardhat's time manipulation for testing

### Next Phase Requirements
- Build vesting UI components
- Create graduation UI indicators
- Implement DEX migration (Unibeam integration)
- Add impact registry for regenerative projects
- Build social features (comments, discussions)

## What's Different from Original

### Before (Old Deployment)
- ‚ùå No vesting - immediate token transfers
- ‚ùå No graduation mechanics
- ‚ùå No fees
- ‚ùå Selling allowed anytime
- ‚ùå No early buyer advantage

### After (New Deployment - Current)
- ‚úÖ Full vesting system
- ‚úÖ Graduation mechanics (market cap/supply)
- ‚úÖ Fee structure (1% buy, 2% sell)
- ‚úÖ Selling only after graduation
- ‚úÖ Early buyer rewards (shorter vesting)
- ‚úÖ No pump and dumps (vesting prevents)
- ‚úÖ Regenerative finance focus

---

## Architecture Comparison

### Pump.Fun Model
- Bonding curve until $69k market cap
- Then migrates to Raydium DEX
- Anyone can sell anytime
- Fast flips and speculation

### Our Model (Pump.Fun + ReFi + Vesting)
- Bonding curve until 69k CELO market cap
- Then enables selling (DEX migration pending)
- **Vesting prevents immediate selling**
- **Early supporters rewarded with shorter vesting**
- **Long-term holder incentive**
- **Regenerative impact focus**

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Build Vesting Dashboard (Priority)

Show before purchase:
- Estimated vesting schedule
- Cliff period
- Vesting duration
- Current tier (early/mid/late/final)

### 4. Test Token Creation

## Congratulations! üéâ

You now have a working pump.fun-style bonding curve platform with:
- ‚úÖ Vesting to prevent pump and dumps
- ‚úÖ Early buyer advantages
- ‚úÖ Graduation mechanics
- ‚úÖ Fee structure for sustainability
- ‚úÖ Foundation for regenerative finance

**What makes this special:**
This is NOT just another pump.fun clone. The vesting mechanism creates **real long-term alignment** between token creators and supporters, perfect for regenerative finance projects where impact takes time.

**Next:** Build the UI to visualize vesting schedules and let users claim their tokens!
